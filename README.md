# decomp-eGRID-methodology
The decomposition analysis included the creation of a model for integrating EPA and EIA data on the U.S. power sector and filling in data gaps using the eGRID methodology. The example R code in this repository is only intended to foster discussion, it should not be used as a production model for creating an integrated power sector database.
